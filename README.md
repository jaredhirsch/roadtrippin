gmaps panorama + streaming/local music == synthetic road trip experience

for fun, not for profit. you'll need your own maps API key if you want to serve a copy from your URL, though.

_update: I abandoned this pretty quickly. It turns out watching "out the window" of the gmaps car is just a really visually unpleasant experience. After all, you bring music and friends on a road trip because looking out the window is boring. And if you aren't actually going anywhere, simulating the boring part using a non-artistic automatically-computed sequence of images is even worse: it's a long joke with no punchline. If anything, this illustrates the value of prototyping stuff before spending a lot of time making the code beautiful, etc: if it sucks at the core, you should just let it go :-P_
